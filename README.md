In this study, the value of the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions were used to predict whether the fetus was in critical or normal condition. This can be done using a variety of supervised learning techniques in machine learning that can be used to predict the health of newborns, especially for critical cases which can help obstetricians obtain detailed information during pregnancy. The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the MinMax-Scaler preprocessing technique to adjust the data range, data sharing using Hold out estimation, and modeling using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, MLPClassifier, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and KKN algorithms.
